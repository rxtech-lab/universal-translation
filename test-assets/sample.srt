Welcome to the Universal Translation demo.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,200
In this video, we'll show you
how subtitle translation works.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,800
First, upload your SRT file
to the translation platform.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Then select your source and target languages.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,500
The AI will automatically detect terminology
that needs consistent translation.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,300
You can review and edit
each subtitle individually.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Timestamps are preserved exactly
as they appear in the original file.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,500
When you're done, export the translated
subtitles as a new SRT file.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,800
The platform supports multiple languages
including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
